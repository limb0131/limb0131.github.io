### Step 1: Creating a Resume
In order to host a resume online, you will need to start out by creating a resume in Markdown format. During this process, keep in mind some of the basics given by Andrew Etter's book. One of the most important things you can do before creating a resume is defining the audience. This will help tailor your resume to the field you are interested in applying for. Furthermore, this will help you narrow down your content and language to fit your audience, cutting away any unnecessary information. Another basic concept that ties into this is style, which is important when producing a well contructed resume. By keepings styling consistent, it can help ehance the overall cohesion of the resume.
