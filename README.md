# How to Host and Format a Resume
## Purpose
The purpose of this README is to provide you with the steps required to host and format your resume on Github Pages. Furthermore, we will analyze Andrew Etter's book "Modern Technical Writing" to incorporate its principles into our resume. 
## Prerequisites
The prerequisites to get started will include the following:
- A resume formatted in Markdown (See link under More Resources to learn more).
- Basic knowledge on how to use Github.
- A Markdown editor (Recommended).
- Andrew Etter's book "Modern Technical Writing" (Recommended. Link to book under More Resources).
## Instructions
This is a step-by-step guide on creating a properly formatted resume and hosting it on Github Pages.
### Step 1: Creating a Resume
  1. Although you can create a resume in a Word document, it is good to get in the habit of using Markdown for such files as it gives alot of control over to the user.

       - As mentioned in Andrew Etter's book, using a lightweight markup language such as Markdown will enable the user to have more options and flexibility when formatting documents.
    
       - When first interacting with a language such as Markdown, it may feel kind of daunting but don't let this discourage you. You will learn that it is not much different with what you may be used to doing, just with a few extra things that give you more control.
    
       - If you find yourself getting confused, a link has been provided with a full tutorial on how to use Markdown, which also includes a cheat sheet. Look under more resources for the link.
    
  2. Now that you have familiarized yourself with Markdown, we will put those skills to use by creating a file that will serve as our resume. Title this file `resume.md` for ease of access.

  3. Now that you have your file ready, we will dive into some of the qualities that make for a proper resume. Everything discussed below will pertain to ideas from Andrew Etter's book.
     
     - **Define your Audience**: When creating a resume, it is important to tailor your resume to whatever field or job you are applying for. Lets say for example that you are applying for a marketing job. In this scenario, you would want to include things such as past marketing projects you've been apart of. Including things such as coding projects you do on your free time would not be beneficial in this case, which leads us to the next point.
       
     - **Don't Duplicate**: Having the same information in multiple places is an unnecessary waste of time and space. It doesn't help with getting your point across and only acts as a distraction from the information you want other's to see. By organizing your resume in key parts, it will help reduce the amount of duplicate information while creating a stronger, more cohesive resume.
       
     - **Style**: Tying into the previous section, make sure to keep styling consistent. Having structure in your resume will help a potential hiring manager to locate different types of informationg effectively. Furthermore, styling and language will indirectly communicate who you are as a person. Structured, consistent styling and language can communicate that you are well organized and put together, while inconsistent styling may communicate that you are more indecisive and erratic.
       
### Step 2: Hosting your Resume on Github Pages
  1. Log in to your Github account and create a new repository with the name `[GithubUsername].github.io`. Make sure the field `[GithubUsername]` is changed to fit your accounts username.
     
     - Creating a new repository can be done by locating the "+" sign at the top right of the webpage.
       
  3. Now that you have the proper repository, you should now able to upload your resume to the repository by clicking on the "uploading an existing file" link.
      
     - Once you've located your resume, add the file along with a description for a commit message, which will help identify what was done when the latest changes were commited.
       
     - This is where the importance of version control can be identified, as we are given access to the history of all changes made in the repository.
       
  5. Now that your resume is in the repository, the last step is to rename your resume file from `[YourResume].md` to `index.md`.

     - Once you've changed your file name and saved the changes along with a commit message, you are done!

  6. Congratulations! Your resume should now be hosted on Github Pages.

     - To verify this is the case, nagivate to `github.com/[GithubUsername].github.io`. The link should nagivate you to your webpage where your resume is displayed.
    
     - If this is not the case and you are not able to see your resume, give it a couple minutes for the system to upload your files to the server, as it may just be an issue of upload times.
    
     - If your resume is still not displayed on your page after being refreshed a couple minutes later, look back at the instructions and make sure you have followed the steps correctly.
